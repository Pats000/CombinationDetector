HOW TO START THE FILE

1. DOWNLOAD THE FOLDER
2. NAVIGATE TO THE FOLDER WITH CMD
3. NOW YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS. YOU CAN START THE FILE WITH DEFAULT test.txt AND ALSO YOU CAN START IT WITH YOUR OWN .txt FILE
      - TO START WITH DEFAULT .txt JUST WRITE "Start.exe" INTO CMD
      - TO START WITH YOUR OWN FILE WRITE "Start.exe file_name". NOTICER THAT IF YOUR CUSTOM FILE IS NOT IN THE SAME FOLDER YOU NEED TO GIVE ALSO THE LOCATION WITH THE FILE NAME.
